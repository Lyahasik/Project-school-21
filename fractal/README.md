# Fractal

The project aims to study fractals, mathematical sets that demonstrate the principle of self-similarity.

In this implementation, it is possible:
- fractal render: mandelbrot, julia, carpet, newton, ship
- scaling by mouse position
- fractal movement
- change the color palette
- change the number of iterations
- dynamic menu

The [`fractal.en.pdf`](/fractal/fractal.en.pdf) file contains the technical documentation of the project.

## How to use on MACos
 
1. go to the "Realization" folder
2. run the `make` command to create the **"fractal"** binary
3. run the program with the card to read `./fractal name_fractal`
