# Project-school-21
Training project portfolio

A technical document is attached to each project, which states in detail what should be implemented and what is allowed for implementation.

In addition, writing projects for the school requires compliance with the internal standard code "norminette". Look [`norme.en.pdf`](/norme.en.pdf).

[`Libft`](/libft) - is the first project from 21 schools. In this project, it is required to independently create a library of functions in which the behavior of other functions from different libraries is recreated.
