# Project-school-21
Training project portfolio

A technical document is attached to each project, which states in detail what should be implemented and what is allowed for implementation.

In addition, writing projects for the school requires compliance with the internal standard code "norminette". Look [`norme.en.pdf`](/norme.en.pdf).

## Content
[`Libft`](/libft) - is the first project from **_School 42_**. In this project, it is required to independently create a library of functions in which the behavior of other functions from different libraries is recreated.

[`get_next_line`](/get_next_line) - function for line-by-line output of information from files.

[`fillit`](/fillit) - the program takes Tetrimino from a file and combines them into the smallest possible shape.

[`ft_printf`](/ft_printf) - the first project in the Department of Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence at **_School 42_**. In this project, you need to create an analogue of the Printf function of the Stdio library.
