# Project-school-21
Training project portfolio

A technical document is attached to each project, which states in detail what should be implemented and what is allowed for implementation.

In addition, writing projects for the school requires compliance with the internal standard code "norminette". Look [`norme.en.pdf`](/norme.en.pdf).
