# Projects-school-21
Training project portfolio

A technical document is attached to each project, which states in detail what should be implemented and what is allowed for implementation.

In addition, writing projects for the school requires compliance with the internal standard code "norminette". Look [`norme.en.pdf`](/norme.en.pdf).

## Content

[`humangl`](/humangl) - importing and running an animated model using OpenGL/Assimp.

[`ft_vox`](/ft_vox) - implement the simplest creation of the minecraft world and navigate through it.

[`scop`](/scop) - write the simplest implementation of reading an object file, displaying an object using OpenGL.

[`RT`](/RT) - you need to write a graphics editor for real-time ray tracing.

[`fractal`](/fractal) - the project aimed at the study of fractals, mathematical sets that demonstrate the principle of self-similarity.

[`fdf`](/fdf) - the first project in the department of graphic programming in **_School 42_**. The project teaches the basics of pixel processing and rendering.

[`corewar`](/corewar) - implementation of the corewar minigame using a pseudo assembler.

[`lem_in`](/lem_in) - find in the graph of rooms the paths along which the ants will go from A to B in the minimum number of steps.

[`push_swap`](/push_swap) - it is required to sort the list of numbers, implementing limited functionality to solve the problem. Implement the ability to check the correctness of a step-by-step solution.

[`filler`](/filler) - mini-game in which you have to defeat a bot by capturing most of the territory.

[`ft_printf`](/ft_printf) - the first project in the Department of Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence at **_School 42_**. In this project, you need to create an analogue of the Printf function of the Stdio library. 

[`fillit`](/fillit) - the program takes Tetrimino from a file and combines them into the smallest possible shape.

[`get_next_line`](/get_next_line) - function for line-by-line output of information from files.

[`Libft`](/libft) - is the first project from **_School 42_**. In this project, it is required to independently create a library of functions in which the behavior of other functions from different libraries is recreated.
