# Libft

This project is one of the first and main ones in School 42. This is a C library with my own implementation of some libc functions, including some additional useful ones.
Most functions are required to write the following projects as we are forbidden to use many ready-made solutions.

The [`libft.en.pdf`](/libft/libft.en.pdf) file contains the technical documentation of the project.

## How to use on MACos
 
 1. open a terminal and go to the ** Realization ** folder
 2. run the **Makefile** using the command `make` (this generates the library as **"libft.a"**)
 3. include **"libft.h"** header in your code and use any libft functions in your project
 4. compile your code with the library using `gcc -o yourExecutable yourSource.c path/libft.a`
